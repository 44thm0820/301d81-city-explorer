# Lab: Class 06 - Asynchronous code, and APIs

**Author**: Rey Mercado
**Version**: 3.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
> Today I will be building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated reqeusts for data from a thrid-party API.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
nvm use 16
npm i
npm start

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
React, Axios, React-bootstrap

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
01-08-2022 1:17am - Application now a fully-functional deployed URL from Netlify, and an updated README to comply with the template for README.md in Lab: Class 06 for 301d81.

01-07-2022 11:56pm - Site could not deploy to Netlify though was successful deploying to local host.  Will implement Ryan Gallaway's fix of redoing the package.json with "mini-css-extract-plugin": "2.4.5" in devDependencies objet.

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Ryan Gallaway thanks to the instructor for finding the fix to allow Netlify to deploy a repo from Github.
